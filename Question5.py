# Q5. How are measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation used to describe
# the spread of a dataset? Provide an example.

# Answer - To describe the spread of a data we will use Variance and Standard Deviation.
#  if the Variance is low then the spread is less and if the variance is high then the spread is high.

# Example - if there are two different variance 2.5 and 7.5 then the dispersion would be high in 7.5.
